In this case please download the ZIP file of the latest version from our site. Then go to Joomla's System menu, find the Install pane, click on Extensions, click on the Upload Package File tab and install the ZIP file you downloaded <strong>twice</strong> in a row, <strong>without</strong> uninstalling Akeeba Ticket System before or in between. The double installation is required to address another long-standing bug in Joomla which sometimes prevents it from copying all of the updated files when installing an extension update."
